# Original Design Concept

The following design is the initial concept and starting point for the Ludus Nexus project. Since an agile development process is being used, the final implementation of this site may differ from the original design concept.

2. [webhallen](https://www.webhallen.com/)

I have chosen the following color palette from [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

The chosen color palette was carefully selected to provide an optimal balance between visual appeal and user-friendly experience. The high contrast between black and white ensures excellent readability and accessibility. The use of grey offers a neutral background for various elements, preventing visual fatigue during prolonged browsing sessions.

The navy blue reflects the sophistication and depth associated with advanced technology and gaming, promoting user trust and engagement. Meanwhile, the striking orange for buttons is not only stylish but also creates a great contrast no matter the background.

The palette also subtly nods to the color schemes of prominent gaming consoles, providing a sense of familiarity for seasoned gamers while maintaining a unique identity for Ludus Nexus. This strategic choice in colors supports our aim to establish a brand that stands out in the competitive gaming marketplace while resonating with our core demographic.
